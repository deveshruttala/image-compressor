# Image Compression Project

This project demonstrates three methods of image compression, emphasizing different technologies and approaches to reduce image file sizes effectively. The implementations include:

1. **C++ GUI Application using Qt Framework:** A desktop GUI application to compress images.
2. **WebAssembly and CMake:** A web-based tool to compress PNG images using WebAssembly.
3. **Huffman Coding Implementation:** An algorithmic approach to compress image data efficiently.

Each method is designed to highlight distinct features, from user-friendly interfaces to optimized algorithmic techniques.

## Installation & Usage


#### Prerequisites
- Install [Qt Framework](https://www.qt.io/download).

#### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deveshruttala/image-compressor.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Qt Creator.
3. Build and run the application.
4. Use the GUI to upload and compress images.



## Project Details

This project demonstrates the versatility of image compression through three unique approaches. The Qt-based GUI application focuses on user experience, allowing users to adjust compression levels visually. WebAssembly extends this functionality to the web, showcasing cross-platform capabilities for PNG compression. Finally, the Huffman Coding implementation provides a deep dive into lossless compression algorithms, highlighting the power of efficient data representation. By combining practical tools with algorithmic insights, this project is a comprehensive exploration of image compression techniques.
